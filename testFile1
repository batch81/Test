"This is one of my first times using git"
"First I needed to clone my remote repository to my local files"
"Then I created a file on my linux file system"
"Now I must add it to the staging area"
"From there I can commit the changes I have made to my local repository"
"Finally I must push these changes to my remote, Test repository"

"I should be able to view this on GitHub, and add a 100 2 lines below"

100 - Hello, this was added from the remote repository.
